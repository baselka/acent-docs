The Osiris Browser has a built-in Armor that blocks ads and malicious scripts. It can be found on the left side of the address bar of the Osiris browser. The icon is light gray when it is deactivated and turns blue when activated.

Below are steps on how to modify the default configuration of the Osiris Armor:

1. Go to a domain or website, (e.g., <https://www.youtube.com/>). Notice that the Osiris Amor icon beside the address bar has changed its color from gray to blue. This notifies that Osiris Armor has

been activated by default.
